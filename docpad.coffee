		serverExtend: (opts) ->

			docpad = @docpad

			# As we are now running in an event,
			# ensure we are using the latest copy of the docpad configuraiton
			# and fetch our urls from it
			latestConfig = docpad.getConfig()
			oldUrls = latestConfig.templateData.site.oldUrls or []
			newUrl = latestConfig.templateData.site.url

			# Redirect any requests accessing one of our sites oldUrls to the new site url
			server.use (req,res,next) ->
