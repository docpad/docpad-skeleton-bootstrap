# [Twitter Bootstrap](http://twitter.github.com/bootstrap/) skeleton for [DocPad](https://github.com/bevry/docpad)
Simple and flexible HTML, CSS, and Javascript for popular user interface components and interactions.

Note: The docpad-less compiler breaks when using the `@import` directive - to change Bootstrap's LESS, you need to compile manually.

## Getting Started

1. [Install DocPad](https://github.com/bevry/docpad)

1. Install the LESS compiler (if you want to change Bootstrap's LESS)
	``` bash
	npm install -g less jshint recess uglify-js
	```

1. Clone the project and run the server

	``` bash
	git clone git://github.com/docpad/twitter-bootstrap.docpad.git
	cd twitter-bootstrap.docpad
	npm install
	docpad run
	```

1. [Open http://localhost:9778/](http://localhost:9778/)

1. Start hacking away by modifying the `src` directory

1. To re-compile bootstrap's LESS, run from the root directory:

	```bash
	lessc src/style/style.less src/files/style.css^C
	```
